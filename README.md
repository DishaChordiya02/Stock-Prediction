# Stock-Prediction

📈 Exploring Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM 🚀

In this project, I embarked on a fascinating journey into the realm of stock market analysis and prediction, harnessing the power of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

Key Technologies Employed:

🐍 Python for comprehensive data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and proficient model implementation.

📓 Jupyter Notebook served as my preferred coding environment, providing an interactive and efficient platform for development.

🧠 Leveraging the Keras library, I meticulously constructed and trained the LSTM model to enhance predictive accuracy.
